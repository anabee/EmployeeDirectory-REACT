## Description

This Employee Directory was created using REACT. There are a couple of components that create the employee list populated with data retrieved from an AJAX call. A call to the API is made every time the page is refreshed, so there will be new employees every time.  The application allows the user to search the list of employees through the search bar. The results are filtered as you type but the button can also allow the user to search. There is one sorting function in the name column that allows the user to alphabetize the users.
